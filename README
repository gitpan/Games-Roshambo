    Games::Roshambo - Perl OO Rock/Paper/Scissors

VERSION
    This document describes Games::Roshambo version 1.00

SYNOPSIS
            #!/usr/bin/perl

            use Games::Roshambo;

            my $rps = Games::Roshambo->new();

            print $rps->judge("rock") . "\n";
            print $rps->judge("scissors", "rock") . "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module manages a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors, aka Roshambo
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors>

INTERFACE
    "new(...)"
        You can specify an optional hashref containing configuration items.

        Valid configuration items are:

        "numthrows"
            The number of separate valid throws for a game, for example, in
            Rock, Paper, Scissors, there are 3 throws, while in a spirited
            game of RPS-101, there are 101 valid throws. If not specified,
            this defaults to 3.

        "sortable"
            OPTIONAL: Behold the madness of Chris Prather. Passing a TRUE
            value to "new" for this item will cause the "judge" method to
            return values of -1 if Player 1 wins, 0 for a tie and 1 for
            Player 2, instead of the 0, 1 and 2 it does normally.

            The entirely dubious benefit of this is that the function can be
            used in conjunction with "sort". It's his fault. He asked for
            it. Any questions as to the relative usefulness of this should
            be directed at him. The management disavows all knowledge.

    "judge(...)"
        This method will judge a game of RPS, returning a 1 for Player 1
        winning, a 2 for Player 2, and a 0 for a tie. (See the "sortable"
        option to "new" above for a twist.)

        It takes up to two arguments, indicating the throws for Player 1 and
        Player 2, as text representations.

        If one or both arguments are omitted, the method will internally
        call $self->gen_throw to randomly generate one.

    "getaction"
        When called with two throws, this will return the text of the action
        for this combination. For example, if called as
        "$rps-"getaction("rock", "paper")> the returned value will be
        "covers".

        This module contains actions for three throw (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
        and 101 throw games, in any other number of throws, this method will
        return undef.

DEPENDENCIES
    None.
