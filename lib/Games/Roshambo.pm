       ### MADNESS!
       ### throws are passed to this function as $x->judge($player1, $player2)
       ### but I'm reversing them when I grab them here. Why? well, this whole
       ### set of logic was based on a "Higher Throw Wins" set of math. Since 
       ### I'm crazy enough to want this to play RPS-101 with throw names,
       ### and since I didn't realize that the whole RPS-101 is based on "Lower
       ### Throw Wins", I was resigned to rewriting the logic itself. 
       ### Chris Prather helped me realize, however, that simply swapping the
       ### values was the same thing. This is why he gets to work at a cool
       ###  job doing cool perl things, while I have to edit badly formed HTML.

=head1 NAME

Games::Roshambo - Perl OO Rock/Paper/Scissors

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Games::Roshambo version 1.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	#!/usr/bin/perl

	use Games::Roshambo;

	my $rps = Games::Roshambo->new();

	print $rps->judge("rock") . "\n";
	print $rps->judge("scissors", "rock") . "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module manages a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors, aka Roshambo L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors>

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<new(...)>

You can specify an optional hashref containing configuration items.

Valid configuration items are:

=over

=item C<numthrows>

The number of separate valid throws for a game, for example, in Rock, Paper, Scissors,
there are 3 throws, while in a spirited game of RPS-101, there are 101 valid throws.
If not specified, this defaults to 3.

=item C<sortable>

OPTIONAL: Behold the madness of Chris Prather. Passing a TRUE value to C<new> for this
item will cause the C<judge> method to return values of -1 if Player 1 wins, 0 for a
tie and 1 for Player 2, instead of the 0, 1 and 2 it does normally.

The entirely dubious benefit of this is that the function can be used in conjunction
with C<sort>. It's his fault. He asked for it. Any questions as to the relative
usefulness of this should be directed at him. The management disavows all
knowledge.

=back

=item C<judge(...)>

This method will judge a game of RPS, returning a 1 for Player 1 winning, a 2 for
Player 2, and a 0 for a tie. (See the C<sortable> option to C<new> above for a twist.)

It takes up to two arguments, indicating the throws for Player 1 and Player 2, as text representations.

If one or both arguments are omitted, the method will internally call $self->gen_throw to randomly generate one.

=item C<getaction>

When called with two throws, this will return the text of the action for this
combination. For example, if called as C<$rps->getaction("rock", "paper")> the
returned value will be "covers".

This module contains actions for three throw (Rock, Paper, Scissors) and 101 throw
games, in any other number of throws, this method will return undef.

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.
